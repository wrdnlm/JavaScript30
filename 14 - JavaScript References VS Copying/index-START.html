    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let name = 'drew';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(team)

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Drew';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    let newTeam = [];
    players.map(player => newTeam.push(player));
    newTeam[3] = 'Mel';
    console.log(newTeam)

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let thirdTeam = [...players];
    console.log(thirdTeam)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    let newPerson = person;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    let thirdPerson = Object.assign({}, person, {
      name: 'drew',
      age: 23 
    });

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
